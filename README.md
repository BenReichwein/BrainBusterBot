## Required

First, you need to make sure that you have NodeJS installed. You can download NodeJS [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). To test that you have installed     Node correctly, type `node -v` into the command line (CMD on windows and Terminal on mac) to display the version of Node that you have installed.

Once you have done that, you can globally install the Browser-Sync package by typing `npm install browser-sync -g` into your command line environment. This       should install the package globally, meaning it is accessible anywhere on your machine.
